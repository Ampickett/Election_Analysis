## Purpose of this analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to show the outcomes of the election by largest county and overall winner. This consists of data for the voter turnout, the percentage of votes for each county, and the highest turount based on the county. Along with the county, we also report on the candidates themselves. This would show the candiates total number of votes, the percentage of votes, and the overall winner based on the number of votes.

## Election Audit Summary

Given that our script runs for 3 counties in Colorado, with some slight modifications, we could apply this to other counties. We could even expand to states, to show different election outcomes. To take this a step further, we could adjust the code to display the number of votes for each candidate by county. Also, we could show the outcomes by county, if needed. This could be used by politicians to find their strongest counties and use that data to focus their efforts on either retaining or gaining ground in counties that are lacking.
